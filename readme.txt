Leaf v.0.1
By NoobScience

Leaf is a simple Qr-COde Generator. It is light weight, easy to use, private and secure.
Leaf is a simple python program I wrote to learn python. It is actually quite useful

To Use it, Enter the data you want to encode and enter the name of the qr-code
Then click generate.

Once you generate the QR-Code, just click the open button to open the QR-Code

The Qr-Codes are Generated in the directory you store leaf. You can regularly clear all the png file by choosing the option
to delete all QR-code in the Edit menu.

Leaf_v.1.1 has the option to generate the Qr-Code in temp directory by deflaut.

Hope you enjoy using Leaf.
